# rooms
## What is this?
This python script grabs a google calendar of room assignments in the ski lease I run and displays some useful stats.
## What's a Ski Lease?
A group of us lease a cabin near Lake Tahoe for the ski season (December through April). Ski lease members can use the cabin as much as they like. 
There are more members (and their guests) than there are rooms so when two or more members want to use the same room on the same night,
 we have a system for determining who gets to use it: Whoever has used the room the least, gets it.
## How do I use this python script?
You don't. The calendar is private to the members of the ski lease. The script requires a json key file that 
I haven't put in the git repository. Sorry. I only put it on github for my personal use.
## How do I join the ski lease?
Contact me.
